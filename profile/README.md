- Welcome to the official Repository of [`Momentam Technologies`](https://github.com/momentam-technologies)
- At Momentam Technologies, we aim to revolutionize how event attendees get their professional photos, ensuring quick and seamless delivery of high-quality images directly to your device.
- Weâ€™re solving the common problem of delayed photo delivery and lost memories by offering a platform where event attendees can instantly connect with photographers, view packages, and receive their photos before the event ends.
- Our mission is to enhance experiences at conferences, weddings, exhibitions, graduations, and more by making photography as easy as booking a ride.
- With Momentam, you can choose the number of photos, check prices, pay, and download your pictures all on the same day, without waiting for post-event links.
